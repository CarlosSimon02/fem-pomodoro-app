## My process

### Technologies Used

- SASS/SCSS for efficient styling
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) Architecture for structured CSS
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture for organized code structure
- NPM (Node Package Manager) for package management
- Mobile-first Workflow for responsive design
- Webpack for module bundling and optimization
- HTML Semantic Tags for structured and meaningful markup

### What I learned

Oh boy! Where do I begin? This Frontend Mentor Challenge has provided me with the densest and most valuable knowledge I've acquired so far.

At first, similar to my previous Frontend Mentor projects, I intended to write this code quickly without much consideration for quality. However, everything changed when I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEr--yTShz8&t=394s) from one of my favorite C++ channels, [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno/). In it, he emphasized that the time spent on a project doesn't guarantee its quality. If you only focus on coding without learning, the resulting code might not be of high quality. His words deeply resonated with me because I had been approaching these Frontend Mentor challenges merely to test my coding speed and project completion time.

This realization inspired me to step out of my comfort zone and delve into more research and learning. In fact, I dedicated more time to learning.

Here's a summary of the things I've learned throughout this process.

#### Open Graph(OG)
#### Accesibility
#### Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
#### BEM(Block Element Modifier) Architecture
#### MVC(Model View Controller) Architecture
#### Progressive Web App(PWA)
#### ES12 Classes
#### Closure
#### Local Storage
#### Node Package Manager(NPM)
